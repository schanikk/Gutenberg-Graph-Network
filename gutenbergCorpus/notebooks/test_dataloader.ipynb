          "Who wants to?”“I will,” said Betty.",
          "”“So do I,” said Betty; “let’s go and read the Riot Act to her.”“No,” said Hester; “let’s write a mandamus or habeas corpus or whatever they call it, and send it up to her by Rosie, and we’ll go for a spin on our wheels.",
          "This was almost too much for Betty; but, not daring to glance at Jessie, she went on about her work, endeavoring not to listen to any further disclosures.",
          "others agreed to this, and Betty and Hester led their wheels, while they all walked along together.",
          "two minutes passed, and Betty went to hide.",
          "Betty had boiled and mashed the potatoes until Millicent declared they looked like cotton batting.",
          "”“Why did they go?” inquired Betty, who liked to know reasons for things.",
          "Oh, you’ve got a future before you!”Betty looked a little dubious, but bravely picked up the basket, saying: “Very well; I’ll peel them, if some one else will fry them.”“I’ll",
          "It was presented by Betty, “because,” as she said, “I came next nearest to getting it, and so I ought to have the melancholy pleasure of handing it over to me hated rival.”The",
          "I_ can’t,” confessed Betty.",
          "“Supper ready?” cried Betty, as they all trooped in.",
          "enough,” cried Betty; “now let’s begin.",
          "But Betty came quickly to the rescue.",
          "The programs were the work of Betty and Hester, and were declared by all to be a triumph of genius.",
          "Betty forgot her part several times, but, being quick-witted, she extemporized bits that were better than her original lines.",
          "But Betty was struggling with a stiff shirt-waist and a pair of sleeve-links, and her fruitless endeavors to bring them into harmony rendered her incapable of good work in that direction.",
          "hackneyed,” returned Betty.",
          "It was the morning after the play, and the house was in a state of “chaos and old night,” as Betty expressed it.“I’m",
          "”“It has a worse effect on me than that,” exclaimed Betty.",
          "you didn’t get our note?” said Betty.",
          "cried Betty.",
          "Well, I hid in such a nice place I inadvertently took a nap, and I’ve had lovely dreams.”“Get up,” cried Betty; “you’re spoiling all the clean clothes, and—you’ve won the prize.”“Have",
          "“Clear out, girls, or you’ll soon weep with those that weep,” cried Betty.",
          "Betty was supposed to be helping Uncle Ned, and Marjorie and Millicent were trying to help the scenic artist; but if their assistance wasn’t very valuable, they at least knew enough not to hinder the head workers.",
          "“But you’ll have to,” cried Betty.",
          "Betty invaded the kitchen, and peeped into the soup-kettle, remarking: “I don’t think there’s very much there; I could eat all that myself.",
          "Let’s do it!”“All right, Betty; and as you’ve announced yourself Peeler, you can begin your vocation.",
          "“Why don’t you take something for that punning habit, Betty?",
          "Just the thing!” cried Betty.",
          "asked Betty.",
          "”“Well, listen, then,” said Betty.",
          "“Why, that’s fine, Betty; I’m proud of you!”",
          "“Now!” said Betty, as they turned back to the deserted dining-room.",
          "“Oh, hang!” said Betty, throwing her links down on the bureau and flinging her shirt-waist across the room.",
          "Soon Betty’s voice was heard from below: “Don’t fiddle with your finery any longer now, girls; come on down and let’s see about supper.”The",
          "cried Betty, as they reached the beach.",
          "And they dabbed poor Betty’s eyes so energetically that they were redder than ever.",
          "Betty seized two tin kettle-covers, and, clashing them like cymbals, broke into the club’s “battle-song,” which they sang on every possible occasion.",
          "”“Yes, they will,” said Betty, confidently; “they’ll have everything ship-shape; don’t you worry.”“From",
          "”“Why, this book is going to be fine,” said Betty.",
          "”“Yes, do,” cried Betty.",
          "Betty the Peeler, have you any suggestions to offer?”But Betty was speechless.",
          "It was only about a mile.",
          "”“Let’s do it,” cried Betty.",
          "Then the six began to hunt for Betty and Millicent.",
          "“Now,” said Betty, “we must have breakfast first of all; and as I cooked most of the dinner last night, it isn’t my turn this morning.",
          "_doesn’t_ do things well,” went on Betty; “she pretends to.",
          "“Let’s play hide-and-seek,” said Betty, one morning.",
          "”“Yes, yes,” said Betty, “that’s all very well; but I’m hungry as a bear, and I’m going home to forage.”The",
          "”“And well you may be,” chimed in Betty, “for you did far more than your share of it.",
          "”“Oh, do something more than think about it,” groaned Betty.",
          "And simultaneously Betty made a wry face and left the table.",
          "When Betty, having finished her course, turned to them, they were in a wild state of excitement.",
          "didn’t take _very_ long,” observed Betty, dryly.",
          "‘Co_lum_bia the _gem_ of the _o_-shun!’”“Betty, you haven’t a speck of romance in your nature,” said Hester, laughing.",
          "”“Yes, do,” said Betty; “two heads are better than one in any barrel.",
          "”“Next,” said Betty, “the rest of us must draw these numbered papers, and—well, draw, then I’ll tell you.",
          "”But the two heads were already bobbing down the walk, and didn’t hear Betty’s parting shot.",
          ",” said Hester, after they had laughed at Betty’s effort, “I can’t be in the picture, because I’ll have to take it, you know.",
          "“He can’t be _brought_ in; he’ll just have to _come_ in,” said Betty.",
          "Betty, you’re a genius!”",
          "“Am I the last?” cried Betty, looking at the girls, who came trooping up to see her hiding-place.",
          "“You _do_ have brilliant ideas sometimes, don’t you, Betsy?",
          "So Betty faced the butcher alone.",
          "cried Betty.",

          "“Does it look soiled?”“Not much,” said Nan, cheerfully; “just a few stains of good old Mother Earth on its fair face.",
          "“Oh,” said Nan, breathlessly, “I thought of course I’d be the last one here.",
          "”“That’s poetic license,” explained Nan, calmly, “but of course you’re too English to see the joke.",
          "“It’s ridiculous,” said Nan, in a hesitating way, “to serve ten fritters to eight people.",
          "“Can’t we get out the silver and table-cloth and set the table now?”“Yes, come on; I love to set a table,” said Nan.",
          "Betty leaned over, and picking up Nan’s blank-book, scribbled in it:Nannie had a little clock,But it was rather slow;And when she thought that it had stopped,The clock was sure to go.",
          "cried Nan; “you don’t understand, and I won’t be made fun of.",
          "She was visionary and romantic, and her special chum was Nan Kellogg, who was lounging in the hammock with her hands clasped behind her head and her eyes closed.",
          "”“Oh, cauliflower!” cried Nan.",
          "Nan Kellogg had fulfilled her own prophecy by coming down fifteen minutes earlier, and then going back home for her cuckoo-clock, which was one of her pet possessions, and which she decided she couldn’t be parted from for two whole weeks.",
          "“Nannie, let’s eat one, and offer our friends a decent dozen.”“All",
          "”“Oh, there’s plenty,” said Nan, who was weighing sugar.",
          "Where is she, Nan?”“Who?",
          "make a snow pudding,” said Nan.",
          "well, my loyal Briton,” said Nan; “you shall air those national views of yours to a small but highly appreciative audience.",
          "“What do we eat it on?”“It’s—it’s a snow pudding,” faltered Nan.",
          "“Yes; set the bloodhound on her track,” said Nan.",
          "can we do it?” said Nan.",
          "“Past or future?” queried Nan.“Oh, past!",
          "“Oh, yes, you can,” said Nan.",
          "Nan and Marguerite, having done nothing toward the preparations, offered their services as waitresses, and, like well-trained club members, they removed one course and served the other in the most approved fashion.",
          "“It’s just half-past,” said Nan; “I supposed they’d be here howling before this.",
          "course we want it the first thing,” said Nan.",
          "”“We will, we will,” said Nan.",
          "“You see, it’s Nannie’s and my turn to get dinner to-day, and there isn’t half enough in the house for such a horde of pirates, and—and we’d have to stay home all the morning to get ready for you!”Marguerite looked the picture of distress at the thought of missing the fun on the beach, and Nan looked placidly indifferent, but had no appearance of intending to be left behind.",
          "Let’s do it,” said Nan.",
          "”Then, amid much laughter and advice from the merry crowd, Nan achieved this masterpiece:STOKER’S SONGA fig for the air-tight furnace,A fig for the shut-up stove;They may suit the modern stoker,But I really can’t approve.",
          "we going to have for supper, Daisy?” asked Nan, as, arm in arm, they sauntered toward the cottage.",
          "“Oh, it’s nothing much,” said Nan; “only that we give a play.”“Is",
          "“Don’t speak to me,” cried Nan, who was wildly manipulating a Dover beater; “this snow pudding won’t snow; it never will when I’m in a hurry.”“Never",
          "I don’t see them,” said Nan, peering under the tables and chairs.",
          "“Guess!” said Nan.",
          "“We can get scenery and costumes from New York and give ‘L’Aiglon’ or ‘Faust’ or something worth while.”“Nonsense!” said Nan.",
          "“Like a burglar,” said Nan; “we’ve expected one ever since we’ve been here, and we may as well have our expectations realized.”“That’s not a bad idea,” said Hester.",
          "Nan tried her best to look unconscious, but only succeeded in looking so funny that the girls went off into peals of laughter.",
          "“Of course,” said Nan, decidedly.",
          "”But Nan was adding a final verse, though her sleepy audience would scarcely wait to hear:“The rest of the evening passed quickly away,And thus came to a close the first happy day.",
          "But if Nan makes our Welsh rarebits I’ll not promise that we won’t be ill.",
          "“Why not call it something to suggest the sea?” said Nan.",
          "”“I will,” said Nan; “and let’s buy a watermelon, and then, with bread and butter and coffee, that will be enough.",
          "do it,” said Nan.",
          "And that reminds me—Nan, can’t I put my best hat in your box?",
          "”“I’ll tell you,” cried Nan.",
          ",” said brilliant Nan.",
          "Nan sang and Marguerite whistled, and occasionally they bumped against each other, and then waltzed a few turns around the kitchen.",
          "”This was agreed to, and Nan read on:“Ere the cooks had time for napping,Suddenly there came a tapping,",
          "the noise, I should think they were building a house,” said Nan; and, sure enough, hammering and pounding was going on below, as well as the clattering of dishes and much scurrying to and fro.",
          "”“Well,” confessed Marguerite, “when we jumped down by the shed steps, there was the pail of milk, and—we just took a drink, and, truly, we didn’t mean to stay so long; but Nannie’s been writing a poem, and I hated to interrupt her till she finished.",
          "Come on; let’s dig up the others.”Nan was easily found, as she had climbed out her bedroom window and was calmly sitting on the roof, gazing at the sea.",
          "do it,” said Nan; “two of them are ours, of course.”So",
          "But Nan was already wearing what the girls called her rapt look, and she paid no attention to their banter.",
          "”“I think it’s down underneath,” Nan went on hopefully.",
          "And there was another mild excitement when Nan’s cuckoo-clock, which was carefully laid away up in the rack, suddenly announced in shrill pipes that it was twelve o’clock.",
          "Oh, I wish Nan and the Matron would come!",
          "“Oh, so it is,” cried Millicent, “and the snow has all melted.",
          "“How did you get here?”The two scapegraces laughed, and Nan said: “Well, you see, it was such a pleasant morning, and such a short walk, we left our hats to home, and, not to disturb the rest of you, we climbed out of our window, and crawled down that low sloping roof, and jumped off.”“Then",
          "”“I am, too,” said Nan; “and I want to go down to the station an hour before train-time, so as to have ample leisure to come back for what I forget.”“Good",
          "merry laughs greeted this speech, and Nan replied: “Indeed they do, and I won’t allow more than three kinds of soup at any one meal.",
          "be in it if she doesn’t hurry,” said Nan.",
          "”“It won’t,” wailed Nan; “and Betty will make fun of it—hers are always perfect.",
          "Why, we met the announcement three blocks up the street, and it led us all the way home, like the Israelites’ pillar of fire.",
          "“Don’t be prosaic, Daisy,” said Nan; “never count the cost during the feast.",
          "”“No, no!” cried Nan; but Marguerite laughed gaily and said: “Why, you girls would ruin a hotel proprietor.",
          "“Well, turn about is fair play,” said Nan, with fun in her eyes.",
          "Hilarity Hall it was, and Nan printed it in big letters on the fly-leaf of her book.",
          "it is,” cried Nan.",
          "Nan appropriated a wicker couch, and announced that she was going to dream dreams and see visions.",
          "What shall I do?”Nan had a blank-book with her which she always carried in case of poetic fire, and the conductor obligingly left the soup-ticket, as Betty called it, for them to copy, and returned later to receive the yellow card, much crumpled by the process of erasure.",
          "Perhaps you’d better grate it.”“No, cut it,” said Nan; “it’s so young and tender.",
          "“Why, it hasn’t any plot,” said Nan.",
          "“I don’t know, I’m sure; but, Nannie, just look at those clouds,—those gorgeous ones behind that clump of pine-trees,—all gold and pink, pushing themselves through the green.",
          "Come on, Nan; the path of glory leads up to our cottage, and we must tread it like the brave heroes that we are.”“When",
          "“What are you dreaming of?”“Oh,” said Nan, opening her eyes, “I was thinking what gay old times we’re going to have down there.",
          ",” said Nan, in her slow, dreamy way, “if Marguerite and I are to get supper to-night, I really believe it’s time we began to think about it.",

          "Tis a curse—a fatal curse!”By this time Millicent was stalking up and down the room, waving her arms about tragically and groaning deeply.",
          "”Lady Pendered sniffed a little at this, and opined that the American customs were beyond her ken.",
          "Millicent afterward confessed to Marjorie that she _did_ want to burn the Lady Lucy’s noble forehead when she frizzed that ridiculous nest on top of her head; but at the time she was a most exemplary lady’s-maid, deft, patient, and willing.",
          "“Yes, she’s not bad,” drawled Lady Lucy; “she darned a bit of a rent in my lace bodice, and smiled amiably when I asked her to do up my fine handkerchiefs.”Millicent as a laundress!",
          "the Chief, up quickly getting,All her pots and pans upsetting,All her dignity forgetting,Sprang across the kitchen floor(With",
          "These tidy and well-favored cooks seemed to rouse Lady Pendered’s ire.",
          "The sudden mental picture of Millicent assisting these ladies at their toilet was too much for her, and with a smothered sound, something between a chuckle and a scream, she hurriedly retreated to the kitchen.",
          "“Why, Millicent Payne!”“Why, Marjorie Bond!”“For goodness’ sake!”“Well, you _are_ nice ones!”“Look at that tray!”“Did you ever?”These exclamations, being all shouted at once, conveyed no intelligence, and the serene Millicent waved her scepter, which was a long stalk of goldenrod, and said:“Minions and slaves, how dare you rush thus unannounced into the royal presence?",
          "But really, dear Lady Pendered, in America one troubles one’s self so little with these matters.",
          "Millicent was a delightful girl to know; she was so clever and bright, and took such an interest in anything that interested anybody else—such a kind, whole-hearted interest, that was neither curious nor critical.",
          ",” said Millicent.",
          "”“Wonderful system!” said Lady Pendered, appalled at this state of culinary perfection.",
          "For a moment Millicent felt annoyed, and her face flushed deep red; then, remembering it was a game, she threw herself into it in her own whole-souled way, and, dropping on her knees before the pale-haired aristocrat, she removed her heavy boots, brought her slippers and put them on for her, and then proceeded to assist her through the intricacies of a very elaborate toilet.",
          "Upon which, Millicent slyly regained the book, unobserved by the stern Matron, and drew a funny sketch of Marguerite wearing epaulets and a cocked hat, mounted on a fiery steed, and commanding a great army.",
          "“Faix, they’ve been shpirited away,” thought the astonished maid.",
          "heavy portière at the end of the dining-room waved convulsively at this, and the too pretty parlor-maid scurried away to a distant room where she could enjoy the joke with some of her fellow-servants.",
          "”Each took a folded paper, and Millicent’s proved to be number one.",
          "On this occasion, therefore, she fairly outdid herself, and when it accompanied a very English-looking joint to the table, Lady Pendered’s delight knew no bounds.",
          "I am forever beneath a ban—a ban—a ban!”At this point Mrs. Lennox entered, and Millicent at once assumed her ordinary manner, though Lady Lucy was quite unstrung.",
          "And Millicent waved her hands with such an impressive gesture that Rosie shot out of the door as if under the influence of a real enchantment.",
          "Then, seeing Millicent’s eyes wander toward the grotesque images, he picked up a snake, which uncoiled itself in such a realistic way that the girls squealed.",
          "“Roseoneal,” continued Millicent, pronouncing it as if it were one word, and speaking in a thrilling tone, “I am a Princess—the Princess Millikens.",
          "Millicent and I will look after the supper; for I’m sure you’ll need one after this wonderful performance, to say nothing of the audience, who, I feel sure, will be utterly exhausted.”“Bravo, Marjorie!” cried Aunt Molly.",
          "maidsIt is an Ancient In-di-an,And he stoppeth here by we;“By thy swarthy face and coal-black hair,Now wherefore loiter ye?”He displayeth his waresHe takes his pack from off his back,Displaying costly wares;The while the girls his movements watchWith interested stares.",
          "Meantime Lady Lucy, in her boudoir, was trying to persuade Millicent to enter her service, and that romantic purveyor of fairy-tales was astonishing the English girl, to her own mischievous delight.“I’d",
          "Pendered and Lady Lucy Pendered,” said the elder guest, in dignified tones; and Marguerite reddened and whipped her tray behind her, wondering if she had made a mistake.",
          "Which Millicent discovered to mean that Lady Lucy would monopolize her services, and Lady Pendered would shift for herself.",
          "Am I clear?”“Clear as mud,” said Millicent; “your plan would be lucid to a doddering idiot.",
          "“Rosie O’Neill, miss,” said the Irish girl, fascinated by Millicent’s gaze.",
          "The Duchess brushed him out with scant ceremony, giving him a cracker to console himself with; but Tim spurned this, and sat up begging for sugar.",
          "Rosie sat on the edge of a chair, her hands tightly clasped and her eyes wide open, enthralled by the tales of magical experiences that Millicent was dramatically pouring forth.",
          "Her reward was a withering glance from Lady Pendered as she drove away, and an overheard remark that “Miranda’s servants were all admirable except that yellow-haired popinjay.",
          "And Millicent sprang off the table and betook herself and her can to the Grotto.",
          "“No; Millicent is still missing,” said Marjorie.",
          "“Of course it must be,” replied teasing Millicent.",
          "Ah, my dear friend, you do not know Lady Pendered, but she represents the very flower of the British aristocracy.",
          "“It’s most extraordinary,” said Lady Pendered; “not only that you should have such capable and well-trained servants, but that they should all be such pretty and neat young girls.",
          "”When Lady Pendered began her speech Hester felt angry; but as she continued, the funny side of it struck the pseudo-cook, and she answered:“Hi couldn’t do it nohow, your ladyship.",
          "When she returned, Lady Pendered was still recounting Millicent’s virtues.",
          "ought to have one of those cash-register things,” said Millicent.",
          "And my clothes were never brushed more neatly.”Millicent brushing clothes!",
          "Millicent bought a bolero jacket, which she put on at once, and catching up the red fez which was Marjorie’s purchase, she perched it sidewise on her saucy head and began to dance a fandango, while Helen played a tinkling air on her banjo.",
          "exclaimed Rosie, clasping her hands and gazing, horror-stricken, at Millicent’s tragic face.",
          "Mrs. Lennox,” said the languid Lucy, “they do seem superior—all except that frivolous parlor-maid of yours.",
          "As Millicent positively declared she could not sing a solo, Nan wrote a recitation for her, and one of the gems of the whole performance was Millicent’s well-renderedMONOLOGUEAll the world’s a stage,And all the men and women merely players;But lovely woman with her witching wilesFar better acts her part than awkward man;With clever, ready wit she takes her cues,Adapts herself to each and every rôle,Is sad or merry, grave or gay, at will;Enacts with equal ease the pert soubrette,Or blushing ingénue, or tragic queen,And in her time plays many various parts,Her acts being seven ages.",
          "she said; but she was fascinated by Millicent’s eyes.",
          "“She wants her hair frizzed again!” said Millicent, in tones of deepest disgust, as she came into the kitchen to fill an alcohol-lamp.",
          "Millicent, what are _you_ good for, anyway?”Millicent was putting away the groceries that were piled on the table in the outer kitchen, or buttery, as Hester called it, and she replied: “Oh, I would ornament any calling; but when I see these candles and kerosene it makes me just long to fill the lamps and candlesticks, ’cause it’s going to get dark pretty soon.”“You’re",
          "exclaimed Millicent, dashing through the hall and into the parlor, where she flung herself into a big wicker rocker.",
          "Helen is my own maid, but I beg you will command her, Lady Lucy.”Lady",
          "Her fair daughter Lucy is a sweet gem of purest ray serene, and they have never known what it was to have less than twenty servants at their finger-ends.",
          "“‘Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!’” began Millicent.",
          "Lucy Pendered was a pale, willowy girl of perhaps eighteen or twenty, with light-blue eyes and straw-colored hair which was most exceedingly frizzed.",
          "”The crowd scattered, and Millicent Payne said: “Well, I’m the last little Injun, and I reckon I’ll go too, and then there’ll be none.”Millicent",
          "“Do you mean for the English ladies to think we’re really servants?”“Of course they must,” cried Millicent, who had waked up to the glorious possibilities of the situation.",
          "As a beginning, Lady Lucy reclined languidly on a couch and thrust out her foot, which was heavily shod, after the most exaggerated English fashion.",
          "”“But I can’t sing,” said Millicent.",
          "Millicent, what _are_ you doing?”Millicent, evidently freed from her enchantment, stood on the dining-table with a kerosene-can in one hand and a lamp-chimney in the other.",
          "Sure there’s nobody in the house at all, at all—savin’ your prisince.”Millicent could think of no explanation for this extraordinary statement, but that didn’t bother her in the least.",
          "”“She’s Zenobia,” said Millicent, “returned to earth in disguise.",
          "“Millicent is indeed a perfect servant,” the hostess was saying; “but all of my maids are.",
          "Although a woman of age and experience, Lady Pendered had never seen just such lady’s-maids as these before, and she raised her lorgnon and stared at them with perhaps pardonable curiosity.“Millicent, attend these ladies,” said Mrs. Lennox, easily.",
          "Fenn went away well pleased with his order, and Millicent dropped into a kitchen chair exhausted.“Girls,” said Hester, “you’ve run up an awful big order; _do_",
          "Millicent slid out of the bed, did up her hair, and was led downstairs in triumph to receive her prize.",
          "Lady Pendered expatiated on the extreme delicacy of her daughter’s constitution, and averred that the Lady Lucy had absolutely no appetite and ate literally nothing.",
          "Then at the milliner’s, where I was buying ribbon, he tore out into her back parlor, and jumped up on a table, trying to reach a little chest of drawers where, it seems, she keeps sugar-lumps.",
          "And I rather think I impressed Mary Pendered with our American superiority in some ways at least.",
          "Millicent stood firmly facing her, with folded arms and screwed-up forehead.“Flour,” said Marjorie.“Butter,” said Millicent.",
          "“Call it the Whitecap,” said Millicent.",

          "“But why so many chairs?” asked Marjorie, as Uncle Ned brought over more and more from his own cottage, and Aunt Molly placed them in compact rows in the parlor.",
          "And she looked at Aunt Molly for confirmation of an offer too good to be true.",
          "As the curtain began to rise, the audience gave way to wild and enthusiastic applause, more boisterous indeed than might have been expected from the sedate and decorous friends whom Aunt Molly had invited.",
          "a flourish and a grand bow, Tom completed his speech and awaited a reply.",
          "“You left the invitation of an audience to your charming and capable aunt, and now ’tis yours not to make reply, yours not to wonder why, but run along and don that fetching costume in which you’re to dazzle the eyes of this large and imposing audience.",
          "And just as the two puzzled-looking maidens met on their veranda, Aunt Molly stepped out on hers.",
          "Uncle Ned politely put the spare seats of his carriage at the disposal of the girls, but the loyal crowd refused to be divided.",
          "“Yea, come, Fairy Godmother,” chimed in Millicent; and well pleased, Aunt Molly trotted over and joined the merry group.",
          "Uncle Ned and two carpenters were building a stage in the parlor, which, though small, was a jolly little affair; and Aunt Molly, who was a bit of an artist, was painting some crude but effective scenery.",
          "presentation speech, and the grandiloquent thanks expressed by the recipient, caused such hilarity that Aunt Molly came running over to hear the fun.",
          "”Betty announced that her committee of stage-managers would be increased by the addition of Aunt Molly and Uncle Ned; and this proved a wise arrangement, for it insured attractive stage-settings and a curtain and footlights that worked beautifully.",

          "call you over if I feel timid,” returned Aunt Molly, who was already half-way down the steps.",
          "Molly and Uncle Ned were politely invited to go home, and then the many hands went at the work, and it was accomplished with surprising quickness.",

          "Ned and Aunt Molly were pleased to accept the invitation which was duly offered them; and then, after a few mysterious confabs with Rosie, the boys declared they were at the young ladies’ services, and all ran down to the beach.",
          "for Aunt Molly!”",
          "this time they were all watching the old lady, who was evidently telling Aunt Molly a fearful tale of woe, for she gesticulated angrily; and though the girls could not hear her words, they gazed at her bobbing feathers and her clenched hands in sympathy with her trouble, whatever it might be.",
          "And the two girls ran across and gratefully seated themselves at Aunt Molly’s cozy table.",
          "After this came blackberry-pies, half a dozen of them, and Aunt Molly fairly blushed as encomiums were showered on her contribution to the spread.",
          "“Oh, I’ll give you those,” said Aunt Molly, “but I want to be of more material help.",
          "are your English friends coming?” asked Aunt Molly.",

          "“Do you suppose he’d help us out, aunty?”“Of course he would,” answered Aunt Molly, heartily; “he’d do anything in his power for the ‘lambs,’ as he always calls you girls.",
          "I don’t exactly see how Uncle Ned could be brought in,” said Aunt Molly, smiling.",

          "Stop in and ask Aunt Molly; she’ll direct you.”“’Tis",
          "But Uncle Ned was so funny as the Amiable Burglar, and introduced such funny jokes and antics into his part, that he was by all odds the star of the evening.",
          "“Come over and breakfast with us,” cried jolly Uncle Ned, not expecting at all that they would do so.",
          "“I know,” he replied; “but your Aunt Molly said we positively could, and so we’re here, and—what do you think of this?",
          "“The play, of course, will represent all us girls here in this cottage; and Uncle Ned might appear as a burglar—a nice, kind one, you know, like ‘Editha’s Burglar.’”“Yes, and he can be real affable and social, and sing solos as he prowls about for his plunder.”“That",
          "“Oh, no,” said Aunt Molly.",
          "”“She’s Minerva in modern clothes,” said Betty, “and she wants Aunt Molly to take her to board.”“Not",
          "Out came the paper-pad and pencils, and genius was set to burning, all of which resulted in several songs for Uncle Ned, whose consent to the plan was fully guaranteed by Aunt Molly.",
          "And the fun was greatly increased when, on reaching the pavilion, they met Uncle Ned and Aunt Molly.",
          "The prices of his goods were exorbitant, but Aunt Molly had dealt with his kind before, and by reason of her sagacious hints of the girls’",

          "And, besides giving them the jolliest house-party they had ever known, Mrs. Lennox presented each of the eight with the dearest little chatelaine watch, engraved with her name and the date of the memorable visit of the Ladies Pendered.*****Transcriber’s Notes:Some illustrations have been moved slightly to keep paragraphs intact.",
          "As the services of the lady’s-maids were required late at night, it had been arranged that Millicent and Helen should sleep at Mrs. Lennox’s; but the other six returned to Hilarity Hall.",
          "mind, my pretty parlor-maid,” said Marjorie; “some are born cooks—that’s me; some achieve cooks—that’s Mrs. Lennox; and some have cooking thrust upon them—and that’s what we’ll do after to-morrow.",
          "Mrs. Lennox’s house was a large and luxurious mansion, exquisitely appointed and with beautiful furnishings.",
          "But Mrs. Lennox’s clear, even voice speaking restored their calm.",
          "XIVWILLING SERVICEAT this unexpected solution of her great problem Mrs. Lennox recovered herself quickly, and exclaimed:“Oh, my dears, if you only would!",
          "In a half-dazed way she realized that Mrs. Lennox was asking her to name Marjorie, and, quite without her own volition, she replied mechanically:“The Duchess, madam.”“What!”",
          "Meanwhile Helen was assisting Mrs. Lennox to don her grandest attire in honor of her titled guests, and not having to masquerade just then, Helen and the eccentric old lady were becoming fast friends.",
          "“Dear Mrs. Lennox,” continued Aunt Molly, “is in a sad dilemma.",
          "Lennox?” murmured the grand lady visitor, somewhat taken aback at the lovely vision confronting her.",
          "cried seven voices; and Mrs. Lennox beamed with delight at the anticipation of the frolics of these young girls in her somewhat lonely house.",
          "“Could you submit to be spoken to as menials?” said Mrs. Lennox.",
          "Mrs. Lennox exclaimed asthe girls filed in“Mr.",
          "”But when the carriage containing the Ladies Pendered was entirely out of sight Mrs. Lennox’s manner underwent a decided change, and the girls realized for the first time how much she, too, had been masquerading.",
          "well,” said Mrs. Lennox.",
          "Jessie and Betty were selected as being the deftest waitresses, and Millicent and Helen were declared ideal lady’s-maids.",
          "”“Who’ll write up the annals of our sojourn at Mrs. Lennox’s?” said Betty.",
          "”“Certainly,” said Mrs. Lennox, though not without some misgivings.",
          "“I think they do,” said Aunt Molly, smiling; “and I can assure you, dear Mrs. Lennox, that whatever these young ladies undertake will be well and thoroughly done.”“How",
          "Stop, I beg of you!”So Hester stopped; and—would you believe it?—such a good time did those girls have at Mrs. Lennox’s house that they never wrote in the “Whitecap” again until after they had left Long Beach and returned to their homes.",
          "”“Yes, madam,” said Helen, gracefully offering the dainty trifle of a shawl; and then Mrs. Lennox sailed downstairs, and the two girls dropped to the floor and rocked back and forth in silent paroxysms of mirth.",
          "all this only made it seem more of a lark, and after copious directions Mrs. Lennox went home, the eight girls promising to appear the next afternoon at two.",
          "Mrs. Lennox, grasping the situation, led her guests to the parlor, remarking:“I allow my maids the use of the piano once a week.",
          "”“Oh, Mrs. Lennox,” cried Marguerite, “how lovely that would be!",
          "“Those are uncommonly pretty attendants you have, Mrs. Lennox,” said Uncle Ned, in a stage-whisper; but Aunt Molly pulled his coat-tail furtively, and said, “How blue the sea is to-night!”Meantime Mrs. Lennox’s usually quiet and dignified home was the scene of wonderful hilarity.",
          "She thought she caught the echo of a giggling retreat to the kitchen, but, determined to play her part as well as she could, she tripped upstairs and announced the guests to Mrs. Lennox.",
          "At two o’clock precisely, on the day of the performance, the eight presented themselves at Mrs. Lennox’s door and were admitted by that lady herself.",
          "One never knows what will happen next.”“I’m rather fond of New York,” said Mrs. Lennox; “but of course its homes are different from English country houses.",
          "LENNOX EXCLAIMED AS THE GIRLS FILED IN.”]S^{T}.",
          "“We are told,” went on Mrs. Lennox, waving her hand dramatically, “that this is a free country!",
          "The two waitresses, intent on doing their best, were so careful and thoughtful that Mrs. Lennox grew more and more dignified and important, as befitted the mistress of such a fine establishment.",
          "This America of yours,” she continued, turning to Mrs. Lennox, “is a most extraordinary place.",
          "”“Yes, I will tell you,” cried Mrs. Lennox, fairly glaring at the flock of girls, who fell in an expectant group at her feet, “for the tale ought to be blazoned abroad to the four winds of heaven!",
          "“Why, it’s Mrs. Lennox,” said Aunt Molly, rising.",
          "CHAPTER XVHILARIOUS HOSPITALITYTHE dinner-table was a surprise even to Mrs. Lennox.",
          "Helen preferred to be Mrs. Lennox’s own maid, so Millicent was allotted to the English visitors.",
          "it is,” said Mrs. Lennox, calmly.",
          "Mrs. Lennox was but very slightly acquainted with her cooks, she felt a trifle uncertain as to their nationality.",
          "“But as president of the Cooking Club I move we accept Mrs. Lennox’s invitation with heartfelt gratitude, and that a copy of these resolutions be engrossed and framed and presented to the lady in question.”“Aye, aye!”",
          "Mrs. Lennox greeted these delightful people, and presented them to her guests.",
          "Nan was ensconced in the library, Helen was with Mrs. Lennox in her boudoir, and Millicent waiting in the guests’ apartments; but the eyes of the other four were peering cautiously from behind doors and portières as the pretty and audacious parlor-maid flung open the front door with an air that would have done credit to a Lord Chamberlain.“Mrs.",
          "Arriving at their rooms, Lady Pendered dismissed Helen, declaring that Mrs. Lennox must need her, and stating that she and her daughter could easily manage with one maid.",
          "continued Mrs. Lennox, warming to her subject and waving both arms about.",
          "“Yes, Dutch, madam,” she said, addressing Mrs. Lennox; “the cook’s assistant is Dutch, and her name is Marjorie.”“So",

          "The costumes I put in the capable hands of Marguerite and Jessie, who know more about clothes in a minute than the rest of us in a thousand years.",
          "Her bonnet was elaborately decked with high feathers, which nodded and bobbed in unison with her quick, jerky footsteps, and over an old-fashioned black silk gown she wore a rich lace mantilla.",
          "Although her own table appointments were fastidiously correct, they had been supplemented by Jessie’s exquisite arrangement of flowers, and by dainty dinner-cards which Millicent had that morning painted in water-color.",

          "Then some of the boys had found time to make cooks’ paper caps for them all, and, with paper roses left from the night before in their buttonholes, their appearance was festive indeed.",
          "The table was laid, and wonderfully pretty it looked, too; for under Jessie’s supervision it had blossomed out into dainty doilies, and bits of shining glass and silver; and in the center was a low basket of goldenrod.",

       " 'There were ten boys, for the eight who came down from Middleton had\\npromptly annexed the two Hillis boys; and the rapidity with which\\nHilarity Hall was put in order was suggestive of a Western cyclone.',\n",
       " '“You girls vamoose,” shouted Roger Hale. “Run upstairs, or outdoors, or\\nacross the street, or somewhere, and quick!”',\n",
       " 'The Blue Ribbon Club as one girl flew upstairs, and proceeded to dictate\\norders over the banister, which, however, were unheeded and even\\nunheard.',\n",
       " 'Timmy Loo danced frantically about among the marauding boys until he was\\nunceremoniously swept out of the front door by Roger’s broom. He was\\nrescued by Rosie, who, much astounded at the turn things had taken, ran\\nover to Aunt Molly’s for shelter and safety. But soon the squall was\\nover and calm reigned again.',\n",
       " '“Come down, girls,” called Ted Lewis. “One free, all free!”',\n",
       " 'Down came the club, bright and smiling, with fresh shirt-waists and the\\nadditional ribbons or trinkets that masculine presence always seems to\\nnecessitate.',\n",
       " '“There, milady,” said Harry Bond to Millicent, “your palace is restored\\nto all its pristine glory, and now fork over that jam.”',\n",
       " 'So the jam and everything else the larder contained was set forth, and\\nthose voracious boys speedily despatched it all.',\n",
       " '“Now,” said Harry Bond, “we’re all going down to the beach to take\\npictures and otherwise enjoy ourselves this pleasant morning; and then,\\nsince you urge us so, we’re all coming back here to dinner.”',\n",
       " '“Do,” said Marjorie, heartily; “that will be lots of fun.” And all the\\nother girls echoed her opinion, except Marguerite and Nan.',\n",
       " '“But you _can’t_!” exclaimed the embarrassed Matron. “You see, it’s\\nNannie’s and my turn to get dinner to-day, and there isn’t half enough\\nin the house for such a horde of pirates, and—and we’d have to stay\\nhome all the morning to get ready for you!”',\n",
       " 'Marguerite looked the picture of distress at the thought of missing the\\nfun on the beach, and Nan looked placidly indifferent, but had no\\nappearance of intending to be left behind.',\n",
       " '“We’ll take the ‘Whitecap’ to the beach with us,” she said, as she put\\non her hat, “and the boys can draw pictures in it. Jack’s quite clever\\nat catching a likeness.”',\n",
       " '“But _what_ about dinner?” said Marguerite, piteously, her\\nresponsibilities as Chaperon suddenly beginning to weigh upon her.',\n",
       " '“That’s all right, Daisy,” said Tom Burleigh, who had been holding a\\nwhispered but emphatic conversation with Harry Bond. “We realize the\\nunexpectedness of this visitation, and ’tis but natural that you girls\\nshould find yourselves unable to cope with it—whereupon and therefore\\nand for which reason we beg to inform you that we will get the dinner\\nourselves, and all we ask of you, fair ladies, is your gracious\\ncompany.”',\n",
       " 'With a flourish and a grand bow, Tom completed his speech and awaited a\\nreply.',\n",
       " '“It doesn’t seem quite right,” said Marguerite; but Betty said:',\n",
       " '“Oh, bother! of course it’s all right. It’ll do you boys good to do a\\nlittle work, and I, for one, accept your invitation with delight.”',\n",
       " '“Me, too!” shouted all the other girls, and Marjorie inquired where the\\ndinner would be served.',\n",
       " '“In Hilarity Hall, of course,” said Tom. “But don’t ask questions, miss.\\nWhen you’re invited out you mustn’t be rude.”',\n",
       " '“And we’ll invite the kind lady and gentleman next door,” put in Roger,\\n“for ’tis to them we owe this trip, anyway.”',\n",
       " 'Uncle Ned and Aunt Molly were pleased to accept the invitation which was\\nduly offered them; and then, after a few mysterious confabs with Rosie,\\nthe boys declared they were at the young ladies’ services, and all ran\\ndown to the beach.',\n",
       " 'They stayed until noon, when Tom Burleigh, who announced himself as\\nMaster of Ceremonies, ordered the whole crowd back to the cottage.',\n",
       " '“Now, ladies,” he said, as they arrived, “every one of you fly upstairs\\nto your rooms, and occupy yourselves with sewing dolls’ rags, or\\nknitting aprons, or whatever pastime pleases you. Take beauty-naps if\\nyou like, but don’t dare to appear on the first floor of this cottage\\nuntil summoned by the dinner-horn.”',\n",
       " 'Marguerite and Jessie wanted to stay and help the new cooks, but it was\\nnot allowed; so upstairs the girls trooped, and Ted Lewis tied rope\\nbarriers across the staircase.',\n",
       " '“Those ridiculous boys!” said Marjorie, as the girls congregated in her\\nroom. “They won’t have half enough plates or forks or anything.”',\n",
       " '“Yes, they will,” said Betty, confidently; “they’ll have everything\\nship-shape; don’t you worry.”',\n",
       " '“From the noise, I should think they were building a house,” said Nan;\\nand, sure enough, hammering and pounding was going on below, as well as\\nthe clattering of dishes and much scurrying to and fro.',\n",
       " 'Of course the girls looked out of the windows, and they saw Rosie and\\nsome of the boys bringing piles of plates and cups from Aunt Molly’s;\\nbut as that lady herself did not appear, they guessed she, too, had been\\nforbidden to assist.',\n",
       " 'After an hour or more of impatient excitement on the part of the girls,\\nRosie came up to them, broadly smiling.',\n",
       " '“The young gintlemin bid me say that dinner is about to be served, and\\nw’u’d yez please come down to the parlor.”',\n",
       " 'So the girls trooped down, and found Uncle Ned and Aunt Molly awaiting\\nthem.',\n",
       " 'Then the boys appeared, and, with obsequious demonstrations of greeting\\nand compliment, they invited their guests to the dining-room.',\n",
       " 'The boys all wore aprons, having confiscated, with Rosie’s help, all\\nthose belonging to the club.',\n",
       " 'Big Tom Burleigh looked especially funny in a lacy, frilly little affair\\nof Jessie’s, and as there had not been quite enough to go round, Harry\\nBond had made a big pinafore of newspapers. Then some of the boys had\\nfound time to make cooks’ paper caps for them all, and, with paper roses\\nleft from the night before in their buttonholes, their appearance was\\nfestive indeed.',\n",
       " 'The dining-room was a sight to behold. They had discarded the regular\\ndining-table, and built a long narrow one of the boards of the\\ndismantled stage. This table, whose length was such that it required\\nthree table-cloths, was decorated with great bowls of paper roses; and\\nthe whole room was decked with green branches, palms, and paper flowers,\\nall of which had done duty as the garden in the play.',\n",
       " 'The twenty people seated themselves at the long and festive board, Uncle\\nNed and Aunt Molly, of course, being invited to sit at the head and\\nfoot; and then Rosie began to serve the feast.',\n",
       " 'But one waitress was far from being enough for that hungry crowd, so the\\nbe-aproned boys took turns in playing waiter.',\n",
       " 'The first course was clam chowder, of which the Burleigh boys were\\njustly famed concocters. It was wonderfully good, and as they had made a\\ngreat kettleful, there was enough and to spare.',\n",
       " 'Next was a course of broiled lobster. Although the boys pretended at\\nfirst that they had cooked these, they afterward confessed that they had\\nordered them sent over from the Inn. But their guests cared not a jot\\nwhere the lobsters had met their fiery fate, and pronounced them the\\nmost delicious ever tasted.',\n",
       " 'After this came blackberry-pies, half a dozen of them, and Aunt Molly\\nfairly blushed as encomiums were showered on her contribution to the\\nspread.',\n",
       " 'The coffee was fine. Ted Lewis always made it in camp, and being\\naccustomed to making large quantities, and in a big tin pail instead of\\na coffee-pot, he had no trouble in turning out a perfect concoction.',\n",
       " 'Crackers and a red-coated cheese made their appearance, also a big\\nbasket of fruit, and Uncle Ned had brought over a box of bonbons, so the\\nmerry crowd sat for a long time over their dessert—so long, indeed,\\nthat the boys were obliged to leave the table and scurry away to catch\\ntheir home-bound train.',\n",
       " '“You’ll have a few dishes to wash,” said Harry Bond, with a twinkle in\\nhis eye. “But that’s woman’s work—a nice housewifely occupation.”',\n",
       " '“Oh, they’ll be done all right,” said his sister; “and now run, Harry,\\nor you’ll be late. Give lots of love to mamma and grandma, and tell\\nthem—” But Harry was out of sight and hearing by that time, so Marjorie\\ndidn’t send her message.',\n",
       " '“Now!” said Betty, as they turned back to the deserted dining-room.\\n“What a clutteration! But I s’pose if ’twere done when ’tis done, ’twere\\nwell ’twere done quickly.”',\n",
       " '“Yes,” said Hester the practical; “let’s fly at it and clear everything\\nup, and then sit out on the veranda and talk it all over.”',\n",
       " 'Aunt Molly and Uncle Ned were politely invited to go home, and then the\\nmany hands went at the work, and it was accomplished with surprising\\nquickness.',\n",
       " 'Then the Blue Ribbon Club grouped itself on the veranda, and if those\\neight tongues didn’t wag!',\n",

       " '“It’s a gorgeous game,” went on Betty, “but it’s not adapted to or for\\ndogs. If the nondescript mop in your lap goes by that name he’ll have to\\nbe buried before we can proceed.”',\n",

       " '“Well, listen, then,” said Betty. “We all hide, you know, and find each\\nother one by one, and then the one who stays hidden longest gets a\\nprize.”',\n",
       " '“Beautiful—beautiful,” sighed Marguerite; “but what is the prize? Might\\nit be worth winning?”',\n",
       " '“The prize can be that photograph I took of you girls in your\\nbathing-suits,” said Hester. “I’ll never be able to get another as good,\\nand it’s so funny it’s worth having.”',\n",

       " '“Rosie,” called Marjorie, “won’t you please take this valuable and\\nhigh-bred morsel of caninity over to Mrs. Warburton’s? And then you may\\ngo for a run on the beach. ’Twill do you good, and besides we want to\\nuse the whole of this palatial residence for a while.”',\n",

       " 'Each took a folded paper, and Millicent’s proved to be number one.',\n",
       " '“Then you go first,” said Betty; “we’ll give you two minutes by Helen’s\\nwatch. In that time you must have hidden yourself either in this house\\nor about its large and spacious grounds. No fair going off the\\npremises.”',\n",

       " 'The two minutes passed, and Betty went to hide. Then the others, one by\\none, until at last Helen was ready to start on her hunting expedition.',\n",
       " '“They wouldn’t be so babyish as to hide behind doors,” she thought, as\\nshe looked behind several. “However, it’s best to be systematic. I’ll\\nopen every door I see.”',\n",
       " 'Acting on this plan, she opened the door of the sideboard as she passed\\nthat old-fashioned and roomy piece of furniture, and, to her surprise,\\nthere was the chubby Marguerite squeezed in between two shelves.',\n",

       " '“Some one would be sure to hide in the kitchen,” declared the canny\\nMatron, so they explored the cupboards there. And, as might have been\\nexpected, away back behind some pots and pans was Hester, who looked\\nangrily at her discoverers.',\n",
       " '“I thought I had such a good place,” she said, crawling out. “How ever\\ndid you find me?”',\n",
       " '“Come on,” cried Helen; “it’s getting to be more fun; let’s find the\\nothers.”',\n",
       " '“Let’s get some buns and milk first,” said Marguerite; “I’m fearfully\\nhungry, and the sight of the cake-box maddens me.”',\n",

       " '“Well, you’re a nice lot!” said Marjorie, suddenly appearing from the\\ncellar. “I hid in the coal-bin, and I’m sure you never would have found\\nme; but when I heard you talking up here, I thought you had found all\\nthe rest.”',\n",
       " '“Never mind,” said Hester; “you’re on our side now. Come on; let’s dig\\nup the others.”',\n",

       " '“You needn’t have hurried on my account,” she said; “I’d just as lief\\nsit here all day.”',\n",
       " 'Jessie was discovered next, standing in a wardrobe among a lot of\\ndresses, which she had fondly hoped would conceal her. And they would\\nhave done so, save that her head showed above them, and her feet below.',\n",
       " 'Then the six began to hunt for Betty and Millicent.',\n",
       " 'It was really a hunt, for they looked in every likely place and a great\\nmany unlikely ones without success. They went downstairs and out of\\ndoors, only to return and search from cellar to attic.',\n",
       " 'At last Jessie, who was peering through the dim, dusty recesses of the\\nlow-ceiled attic, saw an old trunk, and, throwing it open, found Betty,\\ncramped and aching, but game to the last.',\n",
       " '“‘Oh, the mistletoe bough. Oh, the mistletoe bough,’” sang Jessie, as\\nshe helped Betty out.',\n",
       " '“Am I the last?” cried Betty, looking at the girls, who came trooping up\\nto see her hiding-place.',\n",
       " '“No; Millicent is still missing,” said Marjorie.',\n",
       " '“Then she gets the picture,” said Betty, looking disappointed, “and I\\nwanted it.”',\n",
       " '“Never mind, Peeler,” said Hester; “I’ll take another for you, and it\\nwill be just as jolly.”',\n",
       " 'Then they hunted for Millicent. But no trace of her could be found.',\n",
       " '“She’s been shpirited away, I’m thinkin’,” said Rosie, who had returned\\nand was much startled at what she thought an alarming disappearance.',\n",
       " '“Let’s get Timmy Loo and see if he can’t find her,” said Marjorie, after\\nthey had called and yelled and begged Millicent to come to them.',\n",
       " '“Yes; set the bloodhound on her track,” said Nan.',\n",
       " 'So Timmy Loo was brought home, and each girl told him what he was to do,\\nand showed him Millicent’s shoes and gloves and dresses until the poor\\nlittle dog was quite bewildered.',\n",
       " 'But he finally understood, and with a bound he sprang upon Marjorie’s\\nbed, which, by the way, was covered with clean shirt-waists and stiffly\\nstarched skirts just home from the laundry.',\n",
       " '“Oh, Tim, get off those clothes!” cried Marjorie; but Tim only danced\\naround on them and barked.',\n",
       " 'Then he flew to the pillows, and, though much tangled up in the frills\\nof one of Jessie’s clean aprons, he burrowed until he disclosed some\\ntangled curls and a tortoise-shell comb.',\n",
       " '“There she is!” cried Marjorie; and, flinging back the counterpane, they\\nsaw a flushed, rosy face.',\n",
       " '“I’ve been asleep,” said Millicent, yawning and stretching. “What do you\\ngirls want? Oh, I was hiding, wasn’t I? Well, I hid in such a nice place\\nI inadvertently took a nap, and I’ve had lovely dreams.”',\n",
       " '“Get up,” cried Betty; “you’re spoiling all the clean clothes,\\nand—you’ve won the prize.”',\n",
       " '“Have I? Goody! And I haven’t hurt the clothes a bit. Tim did, though,\\nand he woke me up jumping on me.”',\n",
       " 'Then Millicent slid out of the bed, did up her hair, and was led\\ndownstairs in triumph to receive her prize.',\n",
       " 'It was presented by Betty, “because,” as she said, “I came next nearest\\nto getting it, and so I ought to have the melancholy pleasure of handing\\nit over to me hated rival.”',\n",
       " 'The presentation speech, and the grandiloquent thanks expressed by the\\nrecipient, caused such hilarity that Aunt Molly came running over to\\nhear the fun. Then they told her all about the game, and as she was such\\nan appreciative listener, they told her much more, until suddenly Betty\\ncried out:',\n",
       " '“Oh, see that queer-looking person; I believe she’s coming here!”',\n",
       " 'All looked and beheld a tall, imperious-looking lady, garbed in\\neccentric fashion, stalking toward them at a rapid gait. Her bonnet was\\nelaborately decked with high feathers, which nodded and bobbed in unison\\nwith her quick, jerky footsteps, and over an old-fashioned black silk\\ngown she wore a rich lace mantilla.',\n",
       " '“Why, it’s Mrs. Lennox,” said Aunt Molly, rising. “I dare say she’s\\ncoming to call on me. Excuse me, girlies; I must run home.”',\n",
       " '“Let us go with you,” cried Marjorie; “I’m sure you’ll need protection\\nfrom that warlike Amazon. I wouldn’t dare face her alone.”',\n",
       " '“I’ll call you over if I feel timid,” returned Aunt Molly, who was\\nalready half-way down the steps.',\n",
       " 'Sure enough, the stranger turned in at Aunt Molly’s gate, and marched up\\nthe walk as if she were storming a citadel.',\n",
       " '“Jiminy crickets!” whispered Betty, “what can she be? She’s too\\ndistinguished for a book-agent and too excited for a plain every-day\\ncaller.”',\n",
       " '“She’s Zenobia,” said Millicent, “returned to earth in disguise. I think\\nshe’s collecting a regiment and wants us to join it.”',\n",
       " '“She’s Minerva in modern clothes,” said Betty, “and she wants Aunt Molly\\nto take her to board.”',\n",
       " '“Not she,” said Hester; “she’s no summer boarder. I think she’s a\\ndowager countess with several castles of her own.”',\n",
       " 'By this time they were all watching the old lady, who was evidently\\ntelling Aunt Molly a fearful tale of woe, for she gesticulated angrily;\\nand though the girls could not hear her words, they gazed at her bobbing\\nfeathers and her clenched hands in sympathy with her trouble, whatever\\nit might be.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly Aunt Molly called out: “Come over here, girlies; I want you.”',\n",
       " 'Over flew the Octave helter-skelter; but they stood up politely enough\\nwhile Aunt Molly introduced them to her guest.',\n",
       " '“Dear Mrs. Lennox,” continued Aunt Molly, “is in a sad dilemma. Only\\nyesterday—but I will ask her to tell you about it herself.”',\n",
       " '“Yes, I will tell you,” cried Mrs. Lennox, fairly glaring at the flock\\nof girls, who fell in an expectant group at her feet, “for the tale\\nought to be blazoned abroad to the four winds of heaven! Gratitude,\\nthou’rt but an empty name! Respect, honor, deference? Chimeras\\nall—chimeras all!”',\n",
       " 'The girls sat enthralled, though Millicent with difficulty restrained\\nherself from replying to the old lady in kind.',\n",
       " '“We are told,” went on Mrs. Lennox, waving her hand dramatically, “that\\nthis is a free country! No greater, graver misstatement was ever made.\\nWe are slaves!” And she shook her clenched fist at Nan, who chanced to\\nbe nearest her, with such a belligerent air that the poor Poet feared\\nshe was responsible for the national bondage.',\n",
       " '“Slaves!” continued Mrs. Lennox, warming to her subject and waving both\\narms about. “Slaves to our servants! The time has come when they rule\\nus; they dictate to us; they make the laws and we obey them!”',\n",
       " '“Yes’m,” murmured Helen, who thought the ensuing pause ought to be\\nfilled somehow.',\n",
       " '“And now what have my servants done?” she cried, looking from one young\\nface to another, but too engrossed to notice the various expressions of\\nmirth or bewilderment on each.',\n",
