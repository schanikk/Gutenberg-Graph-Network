       " 'CHAPTER 1',\n",
       " 'The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex .',\n",
       " 'Their estate was large , and their residence was at Norland Park , in the centre of their property , where , for many generations , they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance .',\n",
       " 'The late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister .',\n",
       " 'But her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr . Henry Dashwood , the legal inheritor of the Norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it .',\n",
       " \"In the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old Gentleman ' s days were comfortably spent .\",\n",
       " 'His attachment to them all increased .',\n",
       " 'The constant attention of Mr . and Mrs . Henry Dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence .',\n",
       " 'By a former marriage , Mr . Henry Dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters .',\n",
       " 'The son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age .',\n",
       " 'By his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth .',\n",
       " \"To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father ' s inheriting that property , could be but small .\",\n",
       " \"Their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife ' s fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life - interest in it .\",\n",
       " 'The old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure .',\n",
       " 'He was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ;-- but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest .',\n",
       " \"Mr . Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son ;-- but to his son , and his son ' s son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods .\",\n",
       " 'The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters .',\n",
       " 'He meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a - piece .',\n",
       " \"Mr . Dashwood ' s disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement .\",\n",
       " 'But the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth .',\n",
       " 'He survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters .',\n",
       " 'His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him Mr . Dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother - in - law and sisters .',\n",
       " 'Mr . John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable .',\n",
       " 'His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr . John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them .',\n",
       " 'He was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties .',\n",
       " 'Had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was :-- he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife .',\n",
       " 'But Mrs . John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself ;-- more narrow - minded and selfish .',\n",
       " 'When he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a - piece .',\n",
       " 'He then really thought himself equal to it .',\n",
       " 'The prospect of four thousand a - year , in addition to his present income , besides the remaining half of his own mother \\' s fortune , warmed his heart , and made him feel capable of generosity .-- \" Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome !',\n",
       " 'It would be enough to make them completely easy .',\n",
       " 'Three thousand pounds !',\n",
       " 'he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience .\"',\n",
       " '-- He thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent .',\n",
       " \"No sooner was his father ' s funeral over , than Mrs . John Dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants .\",\n",
       " \"No one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband ' s from the moment of his father ' s decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in Mrs . Dashwood ' s situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing ;-- but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immoveable disgust .\",\n",
       " \"Mrs . John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband ' s family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it .\",\n",
       " 'So acutely did Mrs . Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter - in - law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother .',\n",
       " 'Elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in Mrs . Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence .',\n",
       " 'She had an excellent heart ;-- her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught .',\n",
       " \"Marianne ' s abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to Elinor ' s .\",\n",
       " 'She was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation .',\n",
       " 'She was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent .',\n",
       " 'The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great .',\n",
       " \"Elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister ' s sensibility ; but by Mrs . Dashwood it was valued and cherished .\",\n",
       " 'They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction .',\n",
       " 'The agony of grief which overpowered them at first , was voluntarily renewed , was sought for , was created again and again .',\n",
       " 'They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow , seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it , and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future .',\n",
       " 'Elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself .',\n",
       " 'She could consult with her brother , could receive her sister - in - law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance .',\n",
       " \"Margaret , the other sister , was a good - humored , well - disposed girl ; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne ' s romance , without having much of her sense , she did not , at thirteen , bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER 2',\n",
       " 'Mrs . John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland ; and her mother and sisters - in - law were degraded to the condition of visitors .',\n",
       " 'As such , however , they were treated by her with quiet civility ; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself , his wife , and their child .',\n",
       " 'He really pressed them , with some earnestness , to consider Norland as their home ; and , as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs . Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood , his invitation was accepted .',\n",
       " 'A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight , was exactly what suited her mind .',\n",
       " 'In seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself .',\n",
       " 'But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters .',\n",
       " 'To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree .',\n",
       " 'She begged him to think again on the subject .',\n",
       " 'How could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ?',\n",
       " 'And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount .',\n",
       " 'It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why was he to ruin himself , and their poor little Harry , by giving away all his money to his half sisters ?',\n",
       " '\" It was my father \\' s last request to me ,\" replied her husband , \" that I should assist his widow and daughters .\"',\n",
       " '\" He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time .',\n",
       " 'Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child .\"',\n",
       " '\" He did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear Fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do .',\n",
       " 'Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself .',\n",
       " 'He could hardly suppose I should neglect them .',\n",
       " 'But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time .',\n",
       " 'The promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed .',\n",
       " 'Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home .\"',\n",
       " '\" Well , then , LET something be done for them ; but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds .',\n",
       " 'Consider ,\" she added , \" that when the money is once parted with , it never can return .',\n",
       " 'Your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever .',\n",
       " 'If , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy --\"',\n",
       " '\" Why , to be sure ,\" said her husband , very gravely , \" that would make great difference .',\n",
       " 'The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with .',\n",
       " 'If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition .\"',\n",
       " '\" To be sure it would .\"',\n",
       " '\" Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half .-- Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes !\"',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " 'beyond anything great !',\n",
       " 'What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if REALLY his sisters !',\n",
       " 'And as it is -- only half blood !-- But you have such a generous spirit !\"',\n",
       " '\" I would not wish to do any thing mean ,\" he replied .',\n",
       " '\" One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little .',\n",
       " 'No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more .\"',\n",
       " '\" There is no knowing what THEY may expect ,\" said the lady , \" but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do .\"',\n",
       " '\" Certainly -- and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece .',\n",
       " 'As it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother \\' s death -- a very comfortable fortune for any young woman .\"',\n",
       " '\" To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all .',\n",
       " 'They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them .',\n",
       " 'If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds .\"',\n",
       " '\" That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind I mean .-- My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself .',\n",
       " 'A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable .\"',\n",
       " 'His wife hesitated a little , however , in giving her consent to this plan .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure ,\" said she , \" it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once .',\n",
       " 'But , then , if Mrs . Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in .\"',\n",
       " '\" Fifteen years !',\n",
       " 'my dear Fanny ; her life cannot be worth half that purchase .\"',\n",
       " '\" Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty .',\n",
       " 'An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it .',\n",
       " 'You are not aware of what you are doing .',\n",
       " \"I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father ' s will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it .\",\n",
       " 'Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing .',\n",
       " 'My mother was quite sick of it .',\n",
       " \"Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother ' s disposal , without any restriction whatever .\",\n",
       " 'It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world .\"',\n",
       " '\" It is certainly an unpleasant thing ,\" replied Mr . Dashwood , \" to have those kind of yearly drains on one \\' s income .',\n",
       " \"One ' s fortune , as your mother justly says , is NOT one ' s own .\",\n",
       " 'To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one \\' s independence .\"',\n",
       " '\" Undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it .',\n",
       " 'They think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all .',\n",
       " 'If I were you , whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely .',\n",
       " 'I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly .',\n",
       " 'It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses .\"',\n",
       " '\" I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should by no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year .',\n",
       " 'It will certainly be much the best way .',\n",
       " 'A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father .\"',\n",
       " '\" To be sure it will .',\n",
       " 'Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all .',\n",
       " 'The assistance he thought of , I dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season .',\n",
       " \"I ' ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did .\",\n",
       " 'Do but consider , my dear Mr . Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it .',\n",
       " 'Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that ?-- They will live so cheap !',\n",
       " 'Their housekeeping will be nothing at all .',\n",
       " 'They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind !',\n",
       " 'Only conceive how comfortable they will be !',\n",
       " 'Five hundred a year !',\n",
       " 'I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it .',\n",
       " 'They will be much more able to give YOU something .\"',\n",
       " '\" Upon my word ,\" said Mr . Dashwood , \" I believe you are perfectly right .',\n",
       " 'My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say .',\n",
       " 'I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described .',\n",
       " 'When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can .',\n",
       " 'Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then .\"',\n",
       " '\" Certainly ,\" returned Mrs . John Dashwood .',\n",
       " '\" But , however , ONE thing must be considered .',\n",
       " 'When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother .',\n",
       " 'Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it .\"',\n",
       " '\" That is a material consideration undoubtedly .',\n",
       " 'A valuable legacy indeed !',\n",
       " 'And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here .\"',\n",
       " '\" Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house .',\n",
       " 'A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place THEY can ever afford to live in .',\n",
       " 'But , however , so it is .',\n",
       " 'Your father thought only of THEM .',\n",
       " 'And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM .\"',\n",
       " 'This argument was irresistible .',\n",
       " 'It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before ; and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out .',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER 3',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible .',\n",
       " 'But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved .',\n",

       " 'As a house , Barton Cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles .',\n",
       " 'A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind .',\n",
       " 'On each side of the entrance was a sitting room , about sixteen feet square ; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs .',\n",

       " 'In comparison of Norland , it was poor and small indeed !-- but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away .',\n",
       " 'They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy .',\n",
       " 'It was very early in September ; the season was fine , and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather , they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation .',\n",
       " 'The situation of the house was good .',\n",
       " 'High hills rose immediately behind , and at no great distance on each side ; some of which were open downs , the others cultivated and woody .',\n",
       " 'The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows .',\n",
       " 'The prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond .',\n",
       " 'The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them .',\n",
       " 'With the size and furniture of the house Mrs . Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments .',\n",
       " '\" As for the house itself , to be sure ,\" said she , \" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements .',\n",
       " 'Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building .',\n",
       " 'These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage .',\n",
       " 'I could wish the stairs were handsome .',\n",
       " 'But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them .',\n",
       " 'I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly .\"',\n",
       " 'In the mean time , till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a - year by a woman who never saved in her life , they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was ; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home .',\n",
       " \"Marianne ' s pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and Elinor ' s drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room .\",\n",

       " 'He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence .',\n",
       " 'His kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game .',\n",
       " 'He insisted , moreover , on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them , and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day .',\n",
       " 'Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him , denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs . Dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience ; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite , her ladyship was introduced to them the next day .',\n",
       " 'They were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes .',\n",

       " \"Her manners had all the elegance which her husband ' s wanted .\",\n",
       " 'But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by shewing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark .',\n",
       " 'Conversation however was not wanted , for Sir John was very chatty , and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home .',\n",
       " 'On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse .',\n",
       " 'In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others .',\n",
       " 'An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day .',\n",

       " \"The former was for Sir John ' s gratification , the latter for that of his lady .\",\n",
       " 'They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood .',\n",
       " 'It was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass .',\n",
       " 'Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother .',\n",
       " 'He hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources .',\n",

       " 'Continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of Sir John , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife .',\n",
       " 'Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties .',\n",
       " \"But Sir John ' s satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased .\",\n",
       " 'He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen .',\n",
       " 'The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton .',\n",
       " 'The Miss Dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected .',\n",
       " 'It was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person .',\n",
       " 'The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate .',\n",
       " 'In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John , who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them .',\n",
       " 'They would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay .',\n",

       " 'His appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike .',\n",
       " 'There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother - in - law was interesting .',\n",
       " 'Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves .',\n",

       " \"The instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and Marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother ' s account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it .\",\n",
       " \"Marianne ' s performance was highly applauded .\",\n",
       " 'Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted .',\n",
       " \"Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one ' s attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished .\",\n",

       " 'He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste .',\n",
       " 'His pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment .',\n",
       " \"She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel ' s advanced state of life which humanity required .\",\n",

       " 'In the promotion of this object she was zealously active , as far as her ability reached ; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance .',\n",
       " 'She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood .',\n",
       " \"She rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons ' dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again .\",\n",
       " 'It must be so .',\n",
       " 'She was perfectly convinced of it .',\n",

       " \"To the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel ' s advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor .\",\n",
       " 'Mrs . Dashwood , who could not think a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter , ventured to clear Mrs . Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age .',\n",

       " 'There were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable .',\n",
       " 'About a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of Allenham , which issued from that of Barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of Norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it .',\n",
       " 'But they learnt , on enquiry , that its possessor , an elderly lady of very good character , was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world , and never stirred from home .',\n",

       " 'The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned .',\n",
       " \"The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book , in spite of Marianne ' s declaration that the day would be lastingly fair , and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills ; and the two girls set off together .\",\n",

       " '\" Is there a felicity in the world ,\" said Marianne , \" superior to this ?-- Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours .\"',\n",
       " 'Margaret agreed , and they pursued their way against the wind , resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer , when suddenly the clouds united over their heads , and a driving rain set full in their face .-- Chagrined and surprised , they were obliged , though unwillingly , to turn back , for no shelter was nearer than their own house .',\n",
       " 'One consolation however remained for them , to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety ; it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate .',\n",

       " 'Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression .',\n",
       " 'Had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of Mrs . Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance , gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings .',\n",

       " 'In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people , in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged , and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety , he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve , in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support .',\n",
       " 'Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half , of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection , had been rash and unjustifiable .',\n",

Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction , were now actually excited by her sister ; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr . Willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon .',\n",

       " 'But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement , which in fact concealed nothing at all , she could not account ; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice , that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged , and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne .',\n",
       " \"Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all , than Willoughby ' s behaviour .\",\n",
       " \"To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover ' s heart could give , and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother .\",\n",
       " 'The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home ; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham ; and if no general engagement collected them at the park , the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there , where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne , and by his favourite pointer at her feet .',\n",
       " \"One evening in particular , about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country , his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him ; and on Mrs . Dashwood ' s happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring , he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him .\",\n",
       " '\" What !\"',\n",
       " 'he exclaimed --\" Improve this dear cottage !',\n",
       " 'No .',\n",
       " 'THAT I will never consent to .',\n",
       " 'Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded .\"',\n",
       " '\" Do not be alarmed ,\" said Miss Dashwood , \" nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it .\"',\n",
       " '\" I am heartily glad of it ,\" he cried .',\n",
       " '\" May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better .\"',\n",
       " '\" Thank you , Willoughby .',\n",
       " 'But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world .',\n",
       " 'Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when I make up my accounts in the spring , I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you .',\n",
       " 'But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ?\"',\n",
       " '\" I am ,\" said he .',\n",
       " '\" To me it is faultless .',\n",
       " 'Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage .\"',\n",
       " '\" With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose ,\" said Elinor .',\n",
       " '\" Yes ,\" cried he in the same eager tone , \" with all and every thing belonging to it ;-- in no one convenience or INconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible .',\n",
       " 'Then , and then only , under such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton .\"',\n",
       " '\" I flatter myself ,\" replied Elinor , \" that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this .\"',\n",
       " '\" There certainly are circumstances ,\" said Willoughby , \" which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share .\"',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne , whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby , as plainly denoted how well she understood him .',\n",
       " '\" How often did I wish ,\" added he , \" when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited !',\n",
       " 'I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it .',\n",
